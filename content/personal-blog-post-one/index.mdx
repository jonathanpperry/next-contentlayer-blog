## First Personal Post

Hello world! I hope everyone had a nice start to 2024.
This year has been pretty awesome for us Michiganders thus far, with our awesome victories
over both Alabama and Washington for our first National Championship in a long time.

I have been ramping up my coding interview solving skills, so hopefully those should be
pretty good for up to medium complexity problems. Coding interviews can be stressful, but
I'm trying to focus on the most positive aspects of them for now.

I find that life can be pretty frustrating and hard, but I'm trying to find silver linings
and focus on the best. Hope you enjoy the rest of your January and I'll look forward to
seeing you in the next blog post.

Jonathan
