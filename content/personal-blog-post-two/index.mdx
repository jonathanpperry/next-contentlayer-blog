## Welcome to Summer 2024!

It's continued to be an incredibly tough year so far. On the positive end, I was recently able to pass the
AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰! I am aiming for the AWS Developer - Associate next.

A couple fun things from this spring have been going canoeing through Texas Tubes
down the Comal River (I did Texas State Tubes on the San Marcos River last year).

I then spent Memorial Day at the Deep Eddy pool with some friends, which was also a blast!
Here's a pic:

I hope to keep this a bit more updated in the future. Stay positive and be blessed.
