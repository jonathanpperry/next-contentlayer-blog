## Welcome to Summer 2024!

It's continued to be an incredibly tough year so far. Any sort of leads I think I might get have generally been
met with utter disappointment. It really seems to be conditioning for pessimism, which makes it so ironic that
everyone seems to think you need to be incredibly optimistic during job interviews. Why does work, which is so
much of what makes up our human lives, have to be fake and superficial just like the worst things in life?

With the pouting out of the way, a couple fun things from this spring have been going canoeing through Texas Tubes
down the Comal River (I did Texas State Tubes on the San Marcos River last year).

I then spent Memorial Day at the Deep Eddy pool with some friends, which was also a blast!

I hope to keep this a bit more updated in the future. Stay positive and stay blessed.
