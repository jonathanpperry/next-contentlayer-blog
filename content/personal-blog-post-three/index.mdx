## Third Personal Post!

I am updating the blog to post that I passed the AWS Certified Developer - Associate exam!
Hoping this will open some more doors career-wise.

is a link to it.

I have still been playing a lot of pool and though sometimes it seems I'm not getting any better, progress in any area
can feel slow but you don't realize how much you've grown until you really take a look back at where you were before.

I hope to finally grind out the end of "The First 30 Days" and also finish up a sci-fi book club book "Time Enough For Love"
once I finally step away from the intense AWS study (though I've also heard this may not help as much as I first thought).

Peace and see you in the next post.

Jonathan
